Hi, I'm Kingsley Yung, also known as Yung King On (in Cantonese). I recently got my PhD in computer science at [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Andrej Bogdanov](https://andrejb.net/) and [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/).
Before that, I received my BSc in Mathematics and MSc in Computer Science from the same university.

My research interests include probabilistic combinatorics, random constraint satisfaction problems, average-case complexity, cryptography, and any interesting problems in theoretical computer science.

Beyond theoretical work, I enjoy programming and contributing to the open-source community. You can find my code in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kkoyung). Lately, I've been particularly fascinated by the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Its design philosophy resonates with me.
