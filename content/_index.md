Hi, I'm Kingsley Yung, also known as Yung King On (in Cantonese). I'm currently a PhD candidate in theoretical computer science at [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Andrej Bogdanov](https://andrejb.net/).
Before starting my PhD, I received my BSc in Mathematics and MSc in Computer Science from the same university.

My research interests include probabilistic combinatorics, random constraint satisfaction problems, and any interesting problems in discrete mathematics.
