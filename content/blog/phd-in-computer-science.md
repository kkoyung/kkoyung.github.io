Last month, I successfully defended my PhD thesis, and I’ve just submitted the final revisions. I can finally call it complete.

Throughout much of my PhD journey, I often felt stuck and frustrated with my research. However, the last year turned out to be incredible. I wrote my first paper, which was initially rejected twice, but eventually accepted by ICALP 2024. Not only was it accepted, but it also received the Best Student Paper Award—something I never expected.

Around the same time, I finished the draft of my PhD thesis and submitted it to the graduate school. While preparing for my oral defense, I attended the conference to present the paper. Shortly after returning, I completed my defense.

And now, I’m officially a PhD graduate.
